# TES3MATLAB
A package of tools for extracting and visualizing landscape data from TES3 Morrowind and its mods, and exporting maps to a unified scale.

## Alpha version 0.0.1
Command-line run codes extract, clean, merge, process, and visualize maps of landscape data.  Maps are exported as bitmapped PNGs to a specified scale (default 40 pixels per cell).

See showcases on the Tamriel Rebuilt (and Project Tamriel?) forums for a showcase of what this package can do:

## For the future...
- Include alpha channel in exported images
- Save images to a single .tiff (or other layered image format)
- Include seam tests as layers (currently are their own 
- Show where multiple mods edit the same cell and allow switching between sources
- A complete readme with walkthroughs and examples (for Beta version 0.1)
- GUI (for Release version 1.0)
